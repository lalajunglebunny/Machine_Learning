# Machine_Learning
This repository demonstrates my knowledge on various machine learning concepts. The two folders show an investigation done on PCA, LDA and Classification. This was done during my final year of my degree in Electrical & Electronic Engineering at Stellenbosch University where I had a machine learning course, Computer Science E414.
