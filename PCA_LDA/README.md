The ipynb file contains the following features:

- Investigation on Scikit-learn's PCA & LDA classes, and implementing them using the Iris data set with the use of Numpy and Matplotlib.
- Implementation of my own PCA class and verifying it using the Iris data set, comparing it to that of Scikit-learn's PCA class.
